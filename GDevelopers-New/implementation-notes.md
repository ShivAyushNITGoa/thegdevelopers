# Implementation Notes

## Project Structure Cleanup (Current)

We have streamlined the project structure by:

1. Removed all duplicate directories and files:
   - Deleted the old "the-portal" directory
   - Removed redundant "development-plan.md" file
   - Removed the old "src" directory
   - Removed unnecessary "node_modules" directory at the root
   - Kept only the new monorepo structure in "GDevelopers-New"

2. Simplified app structure:
   - Focused on core apps: main and blog
   - Removed incomplete sections: team, projects, and contact (to be implemented properly later)

3. All shared components are properly organized in packages:
   - UI components in the ui package
   - Design system in the design-system package
   - Configuration in the config package

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of the main app with proper routing
2. Develop the blog app with appropriate content and styling
3. Re-add team, projects, and contact apps gradually as they become complete
4. Implement proper routing between all apps
5. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
6. Ensure consistent theme handling across all apps

## Current Working Structure

```
GDevelopers-New/
├── apps/
│   ├── main/       # Main website
│   └── blog/       # Blog section
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/         # Shared UI components
│   ├── config/     # Shared configuration
│   └── design-system/ # Shared design system
```

## Accomplished Tasks

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created a monorepo structure with Turborepo
   - Set up individual Next.js apps for different sections of the site
   - Configured shared packages for UI, configuration, and design system

2. **Component Sharing**
   - Migrated layout components (Header, Footer) to shared UI package
   - Moved theme toggle and provider to shared UI
   - Created basic Button and Card components in shared UI

3. **App Configuration**
   - Set up Next.js configuration for each app with proper basePaths
   - Configured rewrites in the main app to route to other apps
   - Added TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration

4. **Content Migration**
   - Transferred layout and homepage from original site to main app
   - Added additional sections to homepage to showcase multi-app architecture

## Technical Decisions

1. **Routing Strategy**
   - Each app has its own basePath (e.g., /blog, /projects)
   - Main app serves as the entry point and handles rewrites
   - All pages under a specific section are part of that app

2. **State Management**
   - Use React Context for theme and global state
   - Leverage React Server Components for dynamic content
   - Keep state localized to specific apps when possible

3. **Styling Approach**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
   - Share design tokens through the design-system package
   - Maintain consistent look and feel across all apps

4. **Component Architecture**
   - Atomic design principles for UI components
   - Shared layout components for consistent structure
   - App-specific components when needed
